# `web/` - Django Backend

## Coop Proposal to Public Workflow
**TL;DR**: New coops or changes to existing coops are submitted as "proposals" by any authenticated user. Proposals are reviewed and either rejected or approved (and, in turn, made "public") by site administrators.

### Endpoints
| Endpoint | HTTP Verbs | Permission | Description |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| `coops/` | `GET` | `AllowAny` | Returns list of all public coops. |
| `coops/<public_id>/` | `GET` | `AllowAny` |  Returns an individual public coop. |
| `coops/proposal/` | `GET` | `IsAdminUser` | Lists all `CoopProposal`. |
| `coops/proposal/<proposal_id>/` | `GET` | `IsAdminUser` | Returns an individual `CoopProposal`. |
| `coops/proposal/create/` | `POST` | `IsAuthenticated` | Creates new `CoopProposal`. |
| `coops/proposal/review/<proposal_id>/` | `PATCH` | `IsAdminUser` | Reviews a `CoopProposal` and applies changes if `APPROVED`. |

### Data Structure
Three Django models are used for this process.
* `CoopProposal`: Tracks information on proposals, whether or not they have been reviewed, and the related users. 
  * Maps one-to-one to a `Coop` object. 
  * Acts as a historical index to all changes (i.e. approved proposals) and rejected proposals.
  * Statuses:
    * `PENDING`: Proposal has not been reviewed. 
    * `APPROVED`: Reviewed and proposed change has been made public. 
    * `REJECTED`: Reviewed. No changes made. 
* `CoopPublic`: Tracks information on coops that have been made public. Acts as a "master record" or index to all public coops. 
  * Both `CoopProposal` and `Coop` are linked one-to-one to `CoopPublic` to tie together changes made to the same coop. 
  * Statuses:
    * `ACTIVE`: Coop is live and public. Will be returned to users in queries. 
    * `REMOVED`: Coop has been "deleted". We hide this coop from the end user, but maintain it in the database for historical integrity. 
* `Coop`: Contains information on the Coop.
  * Statuses:
    * `ACTIVE`: Current version of Coop data presented to users. Only one `Coop` instance will be active for each `CoopPublic` instance.
    * `PROPOSAL`: Proposed change that has not been reviewed. 
    * `ARCHIVED`: Previously approved version of Coop that has been superseeded by a new version.

## Testing
Tests are stored in the [directory/tests](./directory/tests/) directory using Python's `unittest` framework with additional add-ins from Django and Django Rest Framework. Tests can be run via Django's [manage.py](./manage.py) script. 

Run all tests:
```
python manage.py tests directory.tests
```

Run all tests in a specific file:
```
python manage.py tests directory.tests.[file_name]

Example:
python manage.py tests directory.tests.test_coop_list
```

Run all tests in a specific class:
```
python manage.py tests directory.tests.[file_name].[class_name]

Example:
python manage.py tests directory.tests.test_coop_list.TestCoopList
```

Run a single test:
```
python manage.py tests directory.tests.[file_name].[class_name].[test_name]

Example:
python manage.py tests directory.tests.test_coop_list.TestCoopList.test_list_all
```
